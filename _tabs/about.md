Hi! I'm Linus! :)

This site is my personal portfolio and blogging page on which I will showcase some projects and write about my interests.

# About me

I'm a 22-year-old grad student studying Computer Science at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. My main focus lies on **Data Science**, **Machine Learning** and **AI**, but I am still exploring and getting a feel for various different fields.

Apart from university, I am passionate about **Philosophy of Mind**, Theories of **Consciousness** and the **nature of reality**.
To drop a few names, I strongly resonate with many ideas of **Joscha Bach** (Philosophy, Consciousness, AI), **Stephen Wolfram** (Wolfram Physics, Observer Theory) and **Michael Levin** (Self Organization, Cognitive Agents).

<!-- I have a full [CV](../assets/cv_linus_eickhoff.pdf) available, otherwise the following gives a short overview. -->

## Education

## Work

### Hewlett Packard Enterprise (Sep 2020 - Nov 2023)

At HPE I worked on a bunch of projects in different organizations, mainly focused around **Data Science**, including...

- An **analysis of trends, topics and behaviour** of a german online forum at [DXC Technology](https://dxc.com/)
- The development of a **semantic search engine** for papers in my semester abroad at the [Hewlett Packard Labs](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hewlett-packard-labs.html) in Milpitas, California.
- The development of a **workload-analysis suite** at the [HLRS](https://www.hlrs.de/) in Stuttgart, featuring algorithms and visualizations to detect topologically-inefficient resource usage of jobs running on the supercomputer [HPE Apollo (HAWK)](https://www.hlrs.de/de/loesungen/systeme/hpe-apollo-hawk).

### SPIRITFAKTUR / evi (Jul 2024 - now)

The startup [SPIRITFAKTUR](https://www.spiritfaktur.de/) is a small agency and investment fund, where I work on different projects, related to **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, in part-time.
I switched to the related startup [evi](https://www.elevatorintelligence.com/) (Elevator Intelligence) proceeding with my work, researching and building efficient AI-driven information extraction systems for text and image documents.

### Lecturer at the DHBW Stuttgart (Sep 2024 - now)

I am currently teaching Computer Science Bachelor students in my **Explainable AI** (XAI) course (3 ECTS).\\
I structured and built the course content from the ground up, without previously existing material.
