Hi! I'm Linus! :)

This site is my personal portfolio and blogging page on which I will showcase some projects and write about my interests.

# About me

I'm a 23-year-old grad student studying Computer Science at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. My main focus lies on **Data Science**, **Machine Learning** and **AI**, but I am still exploring and getting a feel for various different fields.

Apart from university, I am passionate about **Philosophy of Mind**, Theories of **Consciousness** and the **nature of reality**.
To drop a few names, I strongly resonate with many ideas of **Joscha Bach** (Philosophy, Consciousness, AI), **Stephen Wolfram** (Wolfram Physics, Observer Theory) and **Michael Levin** (Self Organization, Cognitive Agents).

<!-- I have a full [CV](../assets/cv_linus_eickhoff.pdf) available, otherwise the following gives a short overview. -->

## Education

**University of Stuttgart**
~ M.Sc. in Computer Science
~ Stuttgart, Germany (Oct 2023 - now)

**Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW)**
~ B.Sc. in Computer Science
~ Stuttgart, Germany (Oct 2020 - Sep 2023)

## Work

### CIMC (September 2025 - Now)

I am currently researching self-organizing systems, designing diverse Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) architectures at the [California Institute for Machine Consciousness](https://cimc.ai).
The goal is to build a decomposable hierarchical self organizing model that can be used to study learning in self-organizing systems and test the hypothesis that consciousness is a learning algorithm for self-organized systems.
Check out my project page [here](https://cimc.ai/#research/?projectId=2).

### CERN (March 2025 - August 2025)

This summer, I was working in the [openlab](https://home.cern/science/computing/cern-openlab) team at CERN in Geneva, focusing on Machine Learning and [digital twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin), building a library for large-scale scientific ML simulations on HPC. I learned a lot about distributed machine learning during this time.

### Lecturer at the DHBW Stuttgart (Sep 2024 - Dez 2025)

Teaching Computer Science Bachelor students in my **Explainable AI** (XAI) course (3 ECTS).
The course introduced important foundations of ML and dimensionality reduction, many different models, interpretability methods for CNNs and Transformers, Anthropic [Research](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) on [Mechanistic Interpretability](https://www.transformer-circuits.pub/2022/mech-interp-essay) and more.

I structured and built the course content from the ground up, without previously existing material.

### SPIRITFAKTUR / evi (Jul 2024 - Feb 2025)

The startup [SPIRITFAKTUR](https://www.spiritfaktur.de/) is a small agency and investment fund, where I work on different projects, related to **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, in part-time (just a few hours per week).
I switched to the related startup [evi](https://www.elevatorintelligence.com/) (Elevator Intelligence) proceeding with my work, researching and building efficient AI-driven information extraction systems for text and image documents.

### Hewlett Packard Enterprise (Sep 2020 - Nov 2023)

At HPE I worked on a bunch of projects in different organizations, mainly focused around **Data Science**, including...

- The development of a **workload-analysis suite** at the [HLRS](https://www.hlrs.de/) in Stuttgart, featuring algorithms and visualizations to detect topologically-inefficient resource usage of jobs running on the supercomputer [HPE Apollo (HAWK)](https://www.hlrs.de/de/loesungen/systeme/hpe-apollo-hawk).
- The development of a **semantic search engine** for conference papers in my semester abroad at the [Hewlett Packard Labs](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hewlett-packard-labs.html) in Milpitas, California.
- An **analysis of trends, topics and behaviour** of a big german online forum at [DXC Technology](https://dxc.com/).
